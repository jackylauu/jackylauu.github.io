I'm currently working as a software engineer at an early stage startup. I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with a major in industrial engineering and a minor in math.

During my undergrad, I did a couple internships at the Hong Kong Observatory, SocGen, and JPMorgan Chase, where I got exposure to things like geospatial analysis, anomaly detection and time series classification.

Technology is my passion; however, I also love to learn new things in other areas such as history, mathematics, philosophy and classical music.
